# Skill Gap Analysis
2024 Accelerate App Development with GitHub Copilot Hackathon

## What it does

Utilizes Azure AI to extract and analyze key skills from resumes and job descriptions, highlights missing skills, and provides a similarity score to help users refine their applications.


## How we built it

Leveraged Streamlit for the user interface, Azure Text Analytics for key phrase extraction, and Scikit-learn's TF-IDF and cosine similarity for comparing text. The project was developed collaboratively using GitHub Copilot for coding assistance.

## Challenges we ran into

Handling PDF text extraction was tricky due to inconsistencies in formats. Integrating Azure Text Analytics required careful setup, and ensuring meaningful results for diverse inputs posed challenges.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Building a tool that simplifies a crucial step in job hunting is rewarding. Weâ€™re proud of the seamless integration of Azure AI, the intuitive user interface, and delivering actionable insights.

## What we learned

Deepened our knowledge of Azure services, natural language processing, and effective collaboration with GitHub Copilot to accelerate development.

## What's next for Skill Gap Analysis Tool

We plan to add support for multilingual resumes and job descriptions, improve skill matching accuracy, and integrate personalized career suggestions using advanced AI models.
